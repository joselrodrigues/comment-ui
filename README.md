<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This library is a comprehensive and highly customizable set of React components designed to simplify the development process of the comment-app.

The inclusion of Storybook allows for an interactive and isolated environment to develop and showcase each UI component, facilitating design collaboration and component documentation. 

Rollup, as the module bundler, ensures that the UI Library is efficiently packaged and optimized for both development and production environments. This results in fast load times and minimal overhead, allowing your applications to remain performant and lightweight.
